                    <h2>Why We Do it</h2>
                    <p>
                        Design In Ply was founded by Mark, a furniture designer and cabinet maker,
                        whos passion for beautiful design and joinery fuels the companies ethos.
                        To create bespoke pieces of furniture that stand the test of time,
                        both in its design and consturction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We use plywood for many reasons, it is versatile, strong and has a clean modern asthetic. 
                        Made by layering thin wood fibre sheets together in opposite directions, 
                        creating a strong stable material. It is also very sustainable, using more of the wood
                        from a tree that traditional, solid woods. Using plywoods made from trees like birch 
                        which are fast growing and strong, also helps to reduce its envoirmental impact.
