                    <p>
                        Hi i am mark. Founder and owner of Design In Py. I am a furniture designer and cabinet maker from Co. Dublin.
                        I began my career working for a number of bespoke furniture workshops, around the the dublin area, starting and completing an apprentiship in 
                        cabinetmaking. I went on to study product design at NCAD Dublin. In 2015 after completing my degree, I decided to start Design In Ply.
                        First working out of a basic workshop in Wicklow, I built up my portfolio, skills and customer base. Eventually moving to Glasthule, 
                        where I found a space to open my workshop and design studio.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I fell in love with plywood as a material for creating with, while studying design. It is used a lot in the production of models, 
                        before a project would begin. But I found the material so versatile and strong, to me it made sense to use it as the finish material.
                        It also has a beautiful asthetic, modern with clean lines. It is also more affordable, better for the envoirment and more sustainable.
                        Can be made with avariety of hard and soft woods for different styles.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        I have a passion for furniture design and love being in the workshop bringing the design to life.
                        We are a small company of three, each a skilled cabinet maker and designer
                        We want to meeet our clients, sit down and design what they need and want together. From the most complex to the practical, 
                        pieces of furniture, the same passion and attention to detail goes into every step of the creation.
                        While now my workshop has evolved to incorporate state of the art machines, I still rely on some tried and tested traditional cabinetry
                        skills.
                    </p>
