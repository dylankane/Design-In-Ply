                    <p>When Bee9 Design was founded, it was on the idea of creating unique furniture
                    that actively improves life. That meant raw materials, real craftsmen, and a commitment to trying 
                    new ideas without sacrificing quality. Bee9 Design furniture isn't mass-produced; every new design
                    is a result of months of work, all  in service of creating furniture and accessories that enhance 
                    daily life.
                    </p>
