## Unfixed Bugs

- There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of, coming from any testing. However there is a couple of issues I will point out below, that I have noticed due to its responsiveness


 - The first issue that I will flag is the hero imgage cropping a bit too much of the image as sreen sizes increase. This will require more editing of the photo and possibly more styling with media queries for different screen sizes. It does affect asthetics of the site, in particular on large desktop screens, but I feel not affecting its purpose, or user interface / experience.

 - Another issue with the site that needs attention is the main section of the landing / home page where there is three small paragraphs and two images giving a general outline of the company. The Layout here could also be improved, throughout changing screen sizes. As this was designed with the mobile device as it primary target, it works fine at smaller sizes. But as the screen gets bigger, the ratio of the text and images doesnt quite work asthetically. I used flex box properties to control this section to give me as much responsiveness as possible, but it does need more work. Not affecting the users experience of the site or its overall style and theme.
