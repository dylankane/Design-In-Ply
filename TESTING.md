## Unfixed Bugs

- There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of, coming from any testing. However there is a couple of issues I will point out below, that I have noticed due to its responsiveness


 - The first issue that I will flag is the hero imgage cropping a bit too much of the image as sreen size increase. It does affect asthetics of the site, in particular on large desktop screens, but I feel not affecting its purpose, or user interface / experience. But need to be fixed.

 ### Hero image cropped correctly 

![hero image](documentation/hero-image-bug-small.png)

### Hero image over cropped

 ![hero image cropped](documentation/hero-image-bug-desktop.png)


 - Another issue with the site that needs attention is the main section of the landing / home page where there is three small paragraphs and two images giving a general outline of the company. The Layout here could also be improved, throughout changing screen sizes. It works well at smaller sizes, but as the screen gets bigger, the ratio of the text and images doesnt quite work asthetically. However again at full desktop size the ratio corrects itself. It does need more work. Not affecting the users experience of the site or its overall style and theme.

### Home page content at small screen size looking well

 ### Home page content at desktop screen size looking well
